# Physics Tutorial - VS Code, Git, and GitHub Hands-On Demo

Welcome! This repository is designed for physics researchers to learn practical skills in:
- Using **VS Code** for scientific programming
- Managing code with **Git** version control
- Collaborating on **GitHub**

## 📚 What's Inside

This repository contains three simple Python scripts that demonstrate basic physics concepts:

1. **`basic_physics.py`** - Calculate velocity, acceleration, and force
2. **`projectile_motion.py`** - Analyze projectile motion at different angles
3. **`data_analysis.py`** - Load data, calculate velocities, and create visualizations

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git installed on your computer
- VS Code installed

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JohanvdWesthuizen/qpl_handson_demo.git
   cd qpl_handson_demo
   ```

2. Install required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Scripts

Run each script to see the output:

```bash
python basic_physics.py
python projectile_motion.py
python data_analysis.py
```

## 🎯 Tutorial Exercises

During the workshop, you'll practice:

1. **Editing Code**: Modify values in the scripts to see different results
2. **Git Basics**: Stage, commit, and push your changes
3. **Branching**: Create branches for experiments
4. **Collaboration**: Work with pull requests and code reviews
